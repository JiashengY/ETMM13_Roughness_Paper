    abstract = "{The Reynolds number dependence of Cf, Uo, H and other bulk flow parameters in “two dimensional” (high aspect ratio) rectangular duct flow is explored and the empirical relations Cf = 0.073 Re−1/4 and Uo/U¯ = 1.28 Re−0.0116 are presented. The values A = 2.12 and K = 0.41 for the log-law constants and Π = 0.14 for Coles’ wake parameter are derived and are shown to be independent of Re. The integration of Dean’s formula for the complete velocity profile provides close agreement with all parameters when these values of A, K and Π are used and is shown to coincide with the “optimum log-law” for skin friction (which contains Π).}",

	Once the small-scale structures have been identified, it is necessary
	to assess their importance to the overall dynamics of the turbulence

	both on other small-scale vortices and on the larger-scale field.},

The discrete version of the POD, which is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrices, is described in some detail. The continuous version of the POD is outlined. Low-rank approximations to data using the SVD are discussed. The SVD and the eigenvalue decomposition are compared. Two geometric interpretations of the SVD/POD are given. Computational strategies (using standard software) are mentioned. Two numerical examples are provided: one shows low-rank approximations of a surface, and the other demonstrates simple a posteriori analysis of data from a simulated vibroimpact system. Some relevant computer code is supplied.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed instantaneous velocity fields of a jet in crossflow have
	been measured with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV).
	The jet originated from a fully developed turbulent pipe flow and
	entered a crossflow with a turbulent boundary layer. The Reynolds
	number based on crossflow velocity and pipe diameter was 2400 and
	the jet to crossflow velocity ratios were R = 3.3 and R = 1.3. The
	experimental data have been analysed by proper orthogonal decomposition
	(POD). For R = 3.3, the results in several different planes indicate
	that the wake vortices are the dominant dynamic flow structures and
	that they interact strongly with the jet core. The analysis identifies
	jet shear-layer vortices and finds that these vortical structures
	are more local and thus less dominant. For R = 1.3, on the other
	hand, jet shear-layer vortices are the most dominant, while the wake
	vortices are much less important. For both cases, the analysis finds
	that the shear-layer vortices are not coupled to the dynamics of
	the wake vortices. Finally, the hanging vortices are identified and
	their contribution to the counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) and
	interaction with the newly created wake vortices are described.},
